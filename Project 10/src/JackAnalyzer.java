 *
 * The analyzer program operates on a given source, where source is either a file name
 * of the form Xxx.jack or a directory name containing one or more such files. For
 * each source Xxx.jack file, the analyzer goes through the following logic:
 * 1. Create a JackTokenizer from the Xxx.jack input file.
 * 2. Create an output file called Xxx.xml and prepare it for writing.
 * 3. Use the CompilationEngine to compile the input JackTokenizer into the output file.
